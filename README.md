 Description:
 The problem entails transcription of audio files to the native script of the audio and then translation to English. The languages of interest are as mentioned below. A key element to be considered is that the solution would be required to be tuned for Indian accents. The languages of interest for the problem statement are shown below:  Hindi, Indian Englishâ€š Urdu, Bengali,Punjabi. Datasets pertaining to theses languages will be provided by us, which will consist of two major chunks of data: Training Set and a hidden test set. The participants will have only access to the Training set. They will develop their solutions based on the Training set. After the final solution submission by the participants, the final hackathon rankings will be decided by evaluation on the hidden test set. This is done to ensure that the participants solutions generalize better on newer data. The evaluation metric we want to use for this hackathon will be Word Error Rate (WER). The WER will be computed between the actual translated text with the solution generated text. The lower the WER the better the model.#
